## 🐋 Docker
We provide [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) files for automatically building a Docker image and running the code in a Docker container.
Our code uses Docker compose, which automatically sets up the environment for you with one command.
To use docker with GPUs, make sure to install the `nvidia-container-toolkit` ([link](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)) on the host machine.

To build the docker image and run a container automatically, run the following command from the project root folder:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
To access the command line of the container, run
```bash
docker attach sim_c
```
Use the container's command line to run the desired script (detailed below).
You can detach from the container using `CTRL+D`, and stop the container using `docker compose down`.

### Environment Rendering (Optional)
If you would like to render the environment, it is necessary to set up X11 forwarding.

##### On Windows OS:
we used [VcXsrv](https://github.com/marchaesen/vcxsrv) as an X server.
Then, set up the `DISPLAY` environment variable by executing 
```bash
export DISPLAY=<your-host-ip>:0
```
inside the docker container (after attaching).
This can also be set in the Windows command line using `setx DISPLAY=<your-host-ip>:0` or just `set DISPLAY=<your-host-ip>:0` for the current session only.

You can validate the value is correct by executing `echo $DISPLAY` in the Docker container.

##### Linux OS:
If the game window fails to appear, try executing `sudo xhost +` on the host machine (before attaching to the docker container).


##### Headless Mode
To run in headless mode, execute `export MUJOCO_GL='osmesa'` in the Docker container's terminal before launching the training script.

## 🏗️ Setup
- We highly recommend using Docker for setting up the environment, as described above. 
- If you wish to set up the environment manually without Docker, we recommend following the steps in the `Dockerfile`.
  - Python 3.10
  - Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (torch and torchvision). Code developed with several versions of Pytorch, with the latest being torch==2.4.1, but should work with other recent version.
  - Install [other dependencies](requirements.txt): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Warning: Atari ROMs will be downloaded with the dependencies, which means that you acknowledge that you have the license to use them.

## 🏋️ Launch a Training Run

```bash
python src/main.py benchmark=atari
```

To run other benchmarks use `benchmark=dmc` for DeepMind Control Suite or `benchmark=craftax` for Craftax.
To change an environment within a benchmark, set `env.train.id` by modifying the appropriate configuration file located in `config/env` or through the command line:
```bash
python src/main.py benchmark=atari env.train.id=BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4
```
By default, the logs are synced to [weights & biases](https://wandb.ai), set `wandb.mode=disabled` to turn it off 
or `wandb.mode=offline` for offline logging.



## 📺 Visualizing Trained Models
Download a trained model and use 
```bash
python src/play.py <benchmark> -p <path-to-model-weights>
```
to visualize the agent controlling the real environment live.
For Atari, make sure to use the correct environment ID in the configuration by setting `env.train.id=<game_name>NoFrameSkip-v4` in `config/env/atari.yaml` (e.g., `env.train.id=DemonAttackNoFrameskip-v4`).
For more options, use `python src/play.py --help` or see details below.

For example, to visualize the Craftax agent, download `Craftax.pt` from our [HuggingFace repo](https://huggingface.co/leorc/M3), place it in `Simulus/checkpoints/Craftax.pt` and launch `python src/play.py craftax -p checkpoints/Craftax.pt` (from the attached Docker container).


## 🛠️ Configuration

- All configuration files are located in `config/`, the main configuration file is `config/base.yaml`.
- Each benchmark overrides the base configuration. Each root benchmark config is located in `config/benchmark`.
- The simplest way to customize the configuration is to edit these files directly.
- Please refer to [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) for more details regarding configuration management.

## 📁 Run Folder

Each new run is located at `outputs/env.id/YYYY-MM-DD/hh-mm-ss/`. This folder is structured as:

```txt
outputs/env.id/YYYY-MM-DD/hh-mm-ss/
│
└─── checkpoints
│   │   last.pt
|   |   optimizer.pt
|   |   ...
│   │
│   └─── dataset
│       │   0.pt
│       │   1.pt
│       │   ...
│
└─── config
│   |   config.yaml
|
└─── media
│   │
│   └─── episodes
│   |   │   ...
│   │
│   └─── reconstructions
│   |   │   ...
│
└─── scripts
|   |   eval.py
│   │   resume.sh
|   |   ...
|
└─── src
|   |   main.py
|   |   play.py
|   |   ...
|
└─── wandb
    |   ...
```

- `checkpoints`: contains the last checkpoint of the model, its optimizer and the dataset.
- `media`:
  - `episodes`: contains train / test / imagination episodes for visualization purposes.
  - `reconstructions`: contains original frames alongside their reconstructions with the autoencoder.
- `scripts`: **from the run folder**, you can use the following scripts.
  - `eval.py`: Launch `python ./scripts/eval.py` to evaluate the run.
  - `resume.sh`: Launch `./scripts/resume.sh` to resume a training that crashed.
- `play.py`: Tool to visualize the learned controller / world model / representations. 
    - Use `python src/play.py --help` to print usage information. Currently, this tool only supports `atari` and `craftax` options.
    - Launch `python src/play.py <benchmark> -p <path-to-model-weights>` to watch the agent play live in the environment. If you add the flag `-r` (Atari only), the left panel displays the original frame, the center panel displays the same frame downscaled to the input resolution of the discrete autoencoder, and the right panel shows the output of the autoencoder (what the agent actually sees). The `-h` flag shows additional information (Atari only).
    - Press `R` to start/stop recording a video.

[//]: # (    - Launch `./scripts/play.sh -w` to unroll live trajectories with your keyboard inputs &#40;i.e. to play in the world model&#41;. Note that since the world model was trained with segments of $H$ steps where the first $c$ observations serve as a context, the memory of the world model is flushed every $H-c$ frames.)
[//]: # (    - Launch `./scripts/play.sh -a` to watch the agent play live in the world model. World model memory flush applies here as well for the same reasons.)
[//]: # (    - Launch `./scripts/play.sh -e` to visualize the episodes contained in `media/episodes`.)
[//]: # (    - Add the flag `-h` to display a header with additional information.)
[//]: # (    - Press '`,`' to start and stop recording. The corresponding segment is saved in `media/recordings` in mp4 and numpy formats.)
[//]: # (    - Add the flag `-s` to enter 'save mode', where the user is prompted to save trajectories upon completion.)

## 📈 Results

The folder `results/data/` contains raw scores (for each game, and for each training run).
